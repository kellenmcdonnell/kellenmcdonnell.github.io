						<h3>Essential Questions:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>How do we differentiate between different types of data?</li>
							<li>How can we determine the best methods to represent data sets?</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Objectives:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Students will be able to gather basic quantitative and qualitative data</li>
							<li>Students will be able to plot data using bar graphs </li>

									</span>
								</div>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Prep Work:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Before class, the instructor should write the hook question on the board: “What data can we gather from a bag of M&amp;Ms?”</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Materials:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>One bag of M&amp;Ms for each student.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Procedure Overview:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Hook [6 minutes]</li>
							<li>Quantitative vs Qualitative Discussion [10 minutes]</li>
							<li>M&amp;M Statistics [24 minutes]</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Procedure:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><span class='actTitle'>Hook [6 min]</span>
								<ul>
									<li>As students walk in, the instructor will ask students to brainstorm answers to the question on the board.</li>
									<li>After a few minutes, the instructor will ask students for some of their ideas and write them on the board.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class='actTitle'>Qualitative vs Quantitative [10 min]</span>
								<ul>
									<li>The instructor will explain that data can separated into two types: quantitative and qualitative.  Quantitative data is data that can be numerically represented while qualitative data cannot be.</li>
									<li>For each piece of data on the board, the instructor will conduct a vote to see if students think it is qualitative or quantitative.  If the class votes for the wrong answer the instructor can say that "math isn't a democracy" and explain why the data is what it is.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class='actTitle'>M&amp;M Statistics [24 minutes]</span>
								<ul>
									<li>The instructor will circle a few pieces of data from the board (eg. number of colors, what they are, number of pieces, color distribution, etc.) and tell students to first write down a guess and then find that data for each of their individual bags of M&amp;Ms. After asking for questions, the instructor will have students get their M&amp;Ms.</li>
									<li>After a couple minutes, the instructor will tell the class that they are going to combine their data on the number of each color in the bag.</li>
									<li>The instructor will draw a bar graph on the board and add height to the bars as each student gives his/her data.</li>
									<li>The instructor will ask if the data is what the students expected, and if their data looks the same or different.</li>
									<li>The instructor will ask the students if they think that all bags of M&amp;Ms follow the same statistical trend as the class data.</li>
									<li>The instructor will ask students if they think that the large bar graph is more representative than their graphs.  Talk about how sample size is important in statistics and that the more data you get, the more representative your results will be.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Assessment:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>In the discussion part of M&amp;M Statistics the instructor will give informal feedback if students are correct or not.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Homework:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>There is no mandatory homework, but the instructor may offer bonus points on the mid-unit assessment for students who bring in a data set and a bar graph.</li>

						</ol>
						<h3>Procedure:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><span class='actTitle'>Hook [3 minutes]</span>
								<ul>
									<li>As students walk in, the instructor will have students give them a piece of data to write down (eg. shoe size) and then ask them to attempt to answer the question on the board independently on a piece of paper.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class='actTitle'>Graphing in Excel [7 minutes]</span>
								<ul>
									<li>The instructor will have students get out their laptops and open Excel.  The instructor should project a blank Excel spreadsheet.</li>
									<li>Using the data collected from students, the instructor will enter the data into the spreadsheet and have the students follow along.</li>
									<li>The instructor will walk students through creating a histogram of the data.  The instructor will explain that a histogram represents the frequency distribution (how often certain values occur in a sample) of a data set.</li>
									<li>The instructor will briefly mention the common "bell curve" and how data in that shape is concentrated at a central point with fewer instances of extreme results.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class='actTitle'>Measures of Center [7 minutes]</span>
								<ul>
									<li>The instructor will explain that the center of a data set is the value that summarizes the set (as well as one value can).  It is the "typical" value, the one a person would expect.</li>
									<li>The instructor will crowdsource ways to measure the center of a data set, there are several.</li>
									<li>The instructor will tell the students that the most commonly used measures are the mean and the median.  Then, the instructor will show students how to calculate these values in Excel (using the data set from the hook) as they follow along.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class='actTitle'>Measures of Spread [8 minutes]</span>
								<ul>
									<li>The instructor will explain that the spread of a data set is a value that exhibits how similar the data points are to each other.</li>
									<li>The instructor will ask if students can think of any ways to measure the spread of a data set.</li>
									<li>The instructor can lead students to the answer by explaining that when measuring spread, they are looking to summerize the distance between the points.  In this way, they can take the average of the distances of each point from the center (the mean).  This value is called the standard deviation. </li>
									<li>The instructor will demonstrate how to calculate standard deviation in Excel (using the data from the hook) as the students follow along.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class='actTitle'>Excel Data Exercise [15 minutes]</span>
								<ul>
									<li>The instructor will have students complete the Excel Data Worksheet, allowing them to work with their nearby peers.</li>
									<li>As students work, the instructor will circulate and help students as necessary.</li>
									<li>Students should pass in completed worksheets at the end of class or take them home to finish and pass in the next day.</li>								
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Assessment:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>During the independent working time, the instructor can give students informal feedback.  The instructor should take note of students who may be struggling and consider ways to ensure they do not fall behind.</li>
							<li>After class, the instructor can review the answers from the hook to get a sense for how the students approach unfamiliar topics.  These should not be officially graded, only used as a barometer.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Homework:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Any unfinished worksheets should be completed for homework.</li>
							<li>The instructor may offer bonus points on the mid unit assessment for students who find a data set and find the mean, median, and standard deviation of it for homework.</li>
